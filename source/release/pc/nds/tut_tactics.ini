text=Aggression: Adjust the slider bar to increase or decrease the aggression of your team. The more aggressive your players are, the more determined they will be in the game, but it may mean more free kicks are given away and increase the chances of your players getting yellow and red cards. Use high aggression sparingly to avoid having too many players suspended simultaneously.
