---------------------------------------

Loaned players don't return after the number of weeks set

---------------------------------------
Infinite loop

If you choose a team from a lower division and then get to the arrange friendlies screen,
it will hang indefinitely.

looks like its due to this part of the code:

CCalendar CDivision::FriendlyDate(int FriendlyNum)
{
	ushort FriendlyMatchTpe = FriendlyMatchType(FriendlyNum);
	CCalendar TheDate(WorldData().GetCurrentDate());
	DoFindStartOfSeason(TheDate);

	// Assumes friendly match has not been played yet
	while (GetMatchType(TheDate.GetMatchDay()) != FriendlyMatchTpe)
	{
		TheDate.NextMatchDay();	// forward a match
	}
	return TheDate;
}

---------------------------------------
void CClub::DoTryCoachForManager()
Line 5341 : delete GetCoach();

Crashes

---------------------------------------

Might not be a bug

OnReceiveOfferForPlayer(..) is called for both a normal bid and a loan offer which requires a different interface.
Looking at the reference code, the screen 12 doesn't seem to deal with it being a loan offer.

Our version handles the differences just incase.

---------------------------------------

Not sure if this is a bug

Message Box screen appears after Sacking a player.
If you select Bolton W, and sack R. Gardnir,it will say "The board will not let you sell R. Gardnir for under £995,000.."

If I change his transfer list price higher on the status screen before sacking him, the message box will not appear.

Club.cpp
Assertion failed: _TheOffer.GetBidClub().AreBuyTransfersAllowed() == true, file CClub::DoSoldPlayer:\FDL\projects\footballdirector\source\engine\sports\soccer\Club.cpp, line 4793

This assertion appeared after a player requested a transfer and the user accpeted. Happened on 13/10/07
I think its the same bug as below as it happens at the end of the Country

Happens everytime

---------------------------------------

WorldData.cpp - Fixed
function OnLoadPlayerOut(...) the playerId and clubId are read in the wrong sequence.
this is probably causing the bug below

Related to the bug below
---------------------------------------
WorldData.cpp
Line 435 : GetPlayer(_PlayerID)->GetClub().GetFirstTeamSquad().GotPlayerOnLoan();
Error
---------------------------------------
PlayerSquad.cpp
Line 436 : EXT_ASSERT(iRet < PLAYERSINSQUAD);

Fails if the number of squad members is equal to the maximum.
It should fail if greater than the maximum.

EXT_ASSERT(iRet <= PLAYERSINSQUAD);

---------------------------------------

Youth Squad Screen
When first hiring a youth into the Youth Squad, there isn't a negotiation screen to say that a contract has been entered into. The gamer may mistake the Youth Squad as a team without pay.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*FIXED*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PlayerSquad.cpp
Line 348 : EXT_ASSERT(TotalSquadSize() < PLAYERSINSQUAD)

Looking at the data it looks as if the CPlayerSquad::m_PlayersOutOnLoan is not equal to zero but equals 7 instead. Even though no players are on loan. So even though there are enough spaces left it sometimes believes TotalSquadSize() > 30

This happens after buying a new player from the transferlist, waiting for the negotiation day and accepting player negotiations. Also when trying to promote a youth into the first squad.
